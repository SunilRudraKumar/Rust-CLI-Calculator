# CLI Calculator in Rust

## Overview

This is a simple command-line calculator built using Rust. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) by entering values and an operation symbol (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`). The calculator reads input from the user, parses it, performs the chosen operation, and displays the result.

## Features

- Supports four basic arithmetic operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
- Error handling for invalid input
- Clean code structure using enums, functions, and pattern matching
- Simple and interactive command-line interface

## Requirements

- Rust (for building and running the calculator)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SunilRudraKumar/Rust-CLI-Calculator.git
   cd Rust-CLI-Calculator
   ```
